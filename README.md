# Empowr

Empowr is a daily affirmation app designed to motivate users to read several affirmations each day, enhancing their self-esteem, cultivating a positive outlook, and alleviating stress. It also allows users to anonymously share notes about their encouragement needs, fostering a supportive community where members can exchange anonymous words of motivation and support.

## Setup

- Make sure you have upgraded your MacOS to the latest version.
- Update Xcode to the latest version.
- Install Flutter and Dart by following the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Add `android/app/google-services.json` and `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` to the project.
- `flutter run`

This command will launch the Empowr app on the selected iOS simulator.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues running the app on the simulator, ensure that your project folder is located in a non-iCloud location, as iCloud may cause compatibility problems with Flutter development.
